My test task for the Wikimedia project during Outreachy Intership

I've conducted the initial analysis of translations made with Wikimedia translation tool. It involves both qualitative and quantitative tasks. I gathered data through several API, improved the initial data frame, cleaned the data. 
Here is what I've looked at:
1. Translated articles with the most views in our sample
2. The relative difference in the number of views of the original and translated articles from the day of translation
3. Articles which have more views of translated version, than of original
4. Articles with the highest coefficient of human translations. We can analyze History and Talk pages of these articles, how some sections are translated.
5. Articles with the highest number of revisions
